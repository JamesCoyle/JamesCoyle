I'm a freelance web developer based in Hull, UK. 

My main focus is on frontend development and I'm currently improving my design and user experience skills though I can also work full stack when needed. I've worked on several websites, apps, and browser extensions, some of which can be found here on [GitHub](https://github.com/JamesCoyle?tab=repositories) and others can be found on my [portfolio](https://james-coyle.dev/#portfolio). 

I'm currently a core contributor to the [MaterialDesignIcons](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign) project and maintain several icon components as well as working though issues and providing ideas. I also dabble with electronics and 3D printing when I have time. 

## Prefered tools

I prefer to keep my projects as vanilla as possible because I hate spending hours configuring things and waiting for builds to complete. Currently I use the Svelte framework for front end UI using Sapper/SvelteKit because it is simple, lightweight, requires zero config after initializing the project, and provides server side rendering by default. I use SCSS within Svelte components purely for the nesting it provides as it works out of the box with SvelteKit. Everything else is vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. 

My IDE of choice is VSCode which I use for all web based projects, arduino projects, and most other things. I also use Visual Studio for the rare occations I need to work on .NET based applications. I use PNPM to manage JavaScript packages as it's fast, efficient, and just does things the right way.
